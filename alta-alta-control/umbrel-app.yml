description: >-
  Alta Control is a self-hosted network controller for managing Alta Labs
  networking equipment including access points and switches. Run your own
  local instance instead of relying on the cloud-based manage.alta.inc service.


  Features include device discovery and adoption, network configuration,
  firmware management, and monitoring for your Alta Labs infrastructure.


  Note: For automatic device discovery, your Umbrel device should be on the
  same network as your Alta Labs equipment. Devices require firmware 2.0g+
  (APs) or 2.1c+ (switches) to work with the local controller.
